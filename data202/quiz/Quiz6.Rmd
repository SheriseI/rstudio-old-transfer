## Problem 1

What we're doing here is ...

```{r change-my-name}
# What this code does
```

Based on the result, we conclude that...

## Problem 2
```{r}
product <- c("A1", "A2")
price <- c("2", "3")
df1 <- data.frame(product, price)
```

```{r}
product <- c("Q1-A1", "Q1-A2")
supplier <- c("DDW", "AZZ")
df2 <- data.frame(product, supplier)
```

```{r}
dfj <- inner_join(df1, df2, by="product")
```
