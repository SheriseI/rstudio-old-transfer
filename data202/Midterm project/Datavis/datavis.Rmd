## Overview
We are interested in the relationship between the S&P 500 stock volume and price because it is generally believed that trading volume is a good indicator of the market's trend. We chose to replicate a plot from the following article:
[Opinion: Time to worry? Trading volume is rising when stocks are
falling](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/time-to-worry-trading-volume-is-rising-when-stocks-are-falling-2018-04-27)

```{r original-plot}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/04/26/Photos/ZG/MW-GI064_volume_20180426124007_ZG.jpg?uuid=7ac8348a-4970-11e8-8e97-ac162d7bc1f7")
```

Claim:

> Trading volume is not a good indicator to make conclusions about the
> market's trend.

## Design

The visualization the author chose was a bar graph and
line graph combined. The x-axis represents days in 2018 (January-April). 
The left y-axis shows the S&P trading volume in billions. The right y-axis 
shows the S&P 500's price.

First, they made use of color. The line graph for the S&P 500 price is in blue, 
while the bar graph for the S&P 500 volume is in red. Second, they used lines to separate 
the whole plot in 4 (to separate each month). Third, they "freed" the y-axis on both sides to
represent two different scales.

For at least one of these variables, describe what makes that choice
appropriate or inappropriate. We think the slightly transparent lines
are appropriate so we can see more clearly the difference of movements
between the months.

First, we think that the use of free y-axis scales are effective, 
because we can see the proportions of the two graphs accurately. We can see 
the distribution of the two graphs easily. One thing we think can be done more effectively 
is adding points on the line graph so we can see the actual change in price more clearly. 
Because the binwidth days are very tight, it would be better if we can "zoom in" on
the line graph.

## Data

### Data Overview

We couldn't find the data from the source the article uses. However,
because are data is made readily available on other sites, we are able
to find the same data they used.

The author of the article sourced the data from FactSet. However, the
original data simply comes from S&P/the stock market.

Direct URL:

[Yahoo Finance Historical Data of the S&P
500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC)

The S&P 500 is publicly published data, so we can use it however we
want.

We can directly source the data from the S&P 500 website. However, many
trusted sources like Yahoo Finance provide the same exact data.

As mentioned above, the data just comes from the S&P 500. The article is
written by Mark Hulbert and published on MarketWatch.

As far as we know, no processing have been done to it.

From Investopedia, we know that the S&P 500 price is calculated by
taking "the number of outstanding shares of each company and multiplies
that number by the company's current share price, or market value."

### Data Details

```{r load-data}
sp_fiveyears <- read_csv("data/all_stocks_5yr.csv")

```

```{r}
glimpse(sp_fiveyears)
```

For five years of S&P 500 data (price and volume), the data has 7
columns with the variables `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`,
`volume`, and `Name`.

A single row represents the open, close, highest, and lowest price, and
volume of one stock in the S&P 500 in a single day.

There are `r nrow(sp_fiveyears)` rows.

### Wrangling

ðŸš§ Describe, at a broad level, what you need to do to the data to make it
into the form you need for the plot. (e.g., what data types need fixing,
whether you need to pivot, what filtering is needed, etc.)

ðŸš§ Add code blocks, with appropriate names, for wrangling steps.
**Explain the *why* for any choices you make (like filtering data).**

```{r}
sp2018 <- read_csv("data/2018spdata.csv")
```


## Replication

ðŸš§ Include your replication, along with all code needed. ðŸš§ Briefly
describe any difficulties you encountered, both those you overcame and
those you still have not. (It's ok to not have a perfect graph here. If
the essential structure is there, don't worry if the details are a bit
different. Focus your attention on making an interesting and polished
alternative design.) ðŸš§

```{r}
sp2018 %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = close, x = date) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1, 2, 3))
  geom_line()+
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

## Alternatives

ðŸš§ Describe at least two alternative design choices that could be made in
visualizing your data. For each design, include the following sections

### Alternative 1: Design

ðŸš§ What choice did the original visual make? (e.g., to use a particular
aesthetic mapping or glyph) ðŸš§ What choice does your alternative design
make instead? (It should be a reasonable choice, but it doesn't have to
be an improvement.) ðŸš§ How does that change affect how the visual
supports the original claim? Can your redesign now support some
different claim?

### Implementation

ðŸš§ Make a solid attempt to implement your best alternative design. If
creating it using ggplot/plotly/etc is too challenging, you may include
a high-fidelity sketch of what the plot would look like (using
PowerPoint, a vector graphics tool, or a good-quality scan of a paper or
whiteboard), along with a clear description of what you'd need to figure
out in order to produce it with code.

## Summary

ðŸš§ Now that you've gone through the whole process, how has your
understanding of, and belief in, the original article's claim changed? ðŸš§
How faithful was your replication? ðŸš§ Compare your original and
alternative designs. Which is best for what purpose? ðŸš§ What follow-up
questions and ideas do you have about the data or visualization you
worked with? ðŸš§ How do you feel about this whole experience?
