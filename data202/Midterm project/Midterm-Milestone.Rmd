## How Did Volume Affect the SPY ETF?

The graph we will be reproducing

![](Data%20202.png){width="543"}

The source has various graphs, that we hope to merge together (not on one plot, but maybe side-by-side).

The source of our graphic is Kaggle and here is the link: [How did volume effect the SPY ETF](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sladewoodard/how-did-volume-effect-the-spy-etf/notebook)

There is no initial claim, but the objective is to determine whether or not volume influences investments. The final conclusion after the wrangling and analysis states that that may be a plausible claim, but proves to be incomplete so far...

The data used is from the Huge Stock Market Dataset. There is a lot of data, so the process of selection might be tough. The variables are Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt.
