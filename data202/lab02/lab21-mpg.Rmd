In this document, we explore the MPG dataset provided in the TidyVerse
package. It will follow the model of the lab 1.2 exploration of the
Seattle Pets dataset.

## Loading the MPG Dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(mpg)
mpg
head(mpg, n = 1)
```

-   This dataset has 234 rows and 11 columns.
-   ([MPG dataset
    reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html)).

## Reading and Writing Files

The MPG dataset is pre-loaded in the TidyVerse package, but we could
save it to a file and reload it from there.

We can now read the MPG dataset back in from the file.

```{r, message=FALSE}
write_csv(mpg,'data/mpgdataset.csv')
```

```{r}
mpgdata <- read_csv('data/mpgdataset.csv')
```

## Including Images

RMarkdown allows us to include images.

## Using Equations and Inline Code

RMarkdown also allows us to include equations and inline code
computations. For example, Einstein's famous equation, $e = mc^2$, tells
us that given the speed of light (29979245800 cm/second), the energy
stored in a mass of 1 gram is: `r 1 * 29979245800**2`. (Yep, that's a
pretty big number.)

The average city mpg is `r mean(mpg$cty)` The average highway mpg
`r mean(mpg$hwy)`

## Using the Intermediate Data Types

This document has already includes Tibbles (e.g., `mpg`), a particularly
useful version of the standard data frame used to store datasets. The
other data types we'll use in the course include Dates and Factors.

A *date* is a special type used to represent date-times. For example, it
is currently `r lubridate::now()`. Dates can be manipulated using the
`lubridate` package.

```{r}
lubridate::make_date(year = mpg$year)
```

A *factor* is a special type of *vector* used to represent categorical
data values. For example, though the drive variable in the MPG dataset
is represented as a character, it's probably best seen as a value from a
short list of possible categories: 'f', '4', ...

```{r}
as.factor(mpg$drv)
```

The variables stand for wheel drive types.

## Exploring the Data

<hr>

```{r}
mpg%>%
  count(class, sort = TRUE)
```

The most popular car class in the dataset is an SUV, while the least
popular is a 2 seater.
